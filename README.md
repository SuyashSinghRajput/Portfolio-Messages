# ðŸ“© Messages App

## Overview
This project is a **real-time messaging viewer** built with **Supabase** and vanilla **JavaScript**.  
It fetches messages from a Supabase database and updates the UI instantly whenever new messages are added.  

This app is a **supporting module for my portfolio project**. It shows all the messages I receive from users via the contact form on my portfolio website, helping me keep track of communications efficiently in real-time.

The main purpose of this project is to practice connecting frontend apps to a **backend database**, handle **real-time data updates**, and display messages in a **clean, modern UI**.
